<h2>About Glen</h2>

<p><img style="float:right; margin:.4em 0 .7em 1em;" src="/images/glenhorton-2021-150x150.png" alt="Glen Horton" />I'm Glen.  I spent my childhood in Chicago, but I've spent most of my life in SouthWest Ohio.  I currently live in Cincinnati with my family and <del>two</del> <em>four</em> hungry cats.</p>

<p>I'm a recovering perfectionist.  I embrace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living#Reducing_consumption,_work_time,_and_possessions">minimalism</a> so I can focus on the things that matter in my life and simplify as much as possible (like this simple website).  That means owning less, doing less, and worrying less.  It's a work in progress.</p> 

<p>What am I up to now? (updated 3/20/21)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social distancing (been practicing for this my whole life)</li>
  <li>Working from home</li>
  <li>Trying to focus on the important things (which aren't things)</li>
  <li>Practicing yoga and meditation</li>
  <li>Biohacking my heart rate variability</li>
  <li><em>Trying</em> to learn new juggling tricks (it's hard)</li>
  <li>Reading <u>The Girl Who Played with Fire</u> by Stieg Larsson</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm passionate about libraries and free access to information.  I'm also passionate about technology, especially open source software and web applications.  I started supporting technologies in libraries in 1992 while I attended Wright State University.  Over the past 25 years I've helped public, academic, school, and special libraries use technology to provide better services to their patrons.
  
<p>I currently lead the Application Development Unit at the University of Cincinnati Libraries. Most of my time is spent leading an agile group of developers on open source projects like <a href = "https://scholar.uc.edu">Scholar@UC</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests include open source software communities, collaborative software development, diversity in software engineering, agile development methods, and mining software repositories.</p>

<p>Random tidbits:</p>
